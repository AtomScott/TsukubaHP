Summary: 

I am currently leading a team which is building the University of Tsukuba FC's website.

For lack of a better option, we started off using a custom wordpress template and have been continuously improving it ever since.

It has a challenge since we lacked the resources, in time, knowledge and funding. However, after working on this project for two we have started to see some results.

Currently we have over 10000 active users and are planning on incorporating sponsors within page, to generate revenue which will be used to accelerate development.
